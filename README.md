# noisy-parameters-transition
Experiments for phase transition in learnability for increasing noise in parameter space of neural networks

### Organization
I use `sacred` to manage experiments (open to alternatives), which conveniently stores experiment configuration and results data. Scripts in the `scripts` directory run experiments and I'm currently storing results locally. I suspect that the data coming off these experiments may be small enough to just commit to the repo and share that way, but if not we could use some cloud-hosted database to store the results. Let's not make things too complicated. This isn't a huge project.

Notebooks for visualizing experimental data, runningi small tests, etc. are in `notebooks`.
